/**
 * The dated items behind "This week" (front page) and "Dates in this story"
 * (article page).
 *
 * Both panels print dates out of PUBLISHED STORIES ONLY -- never a meeting
 * calendar and never an unpublished lead (owner ruling, Scott, 2026-09-26).
 * The one structured date a printed story carries per source is
 * `ProvenanceItem.document_date`: the day the record itself bears, which is
 * what a captured agenda, notice or filing states, and therefore the date a
 * reader can go and check. `routine_notice_publications.issue_date` is the day
 * an edition went out, not the date inside it, so it is not read here.
 *
 * `document_date` is a free-form string on the wire -- `report.ts` coerces
 * whatever the scanner reported. Only an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix is treated as
 * a date; anything else ("early September", "Sept 7") is skipped here and is
 * still printed verbatim in the article's provenance appendix, so nothing is
 * lost by not guessing at it.
 *
 * The premise of these panels is written up in full in
 * `questions/BD-redesign-phase1-paper.md`. Nothing in this schema records a
 * cancelled event, which is why `cancelled` exists on the row and is never set
 * from data, and why an honest short panel is a real state rather than a bug.
