 * this app's own origin, so it rides along with every request automatically and
 * call sites thread nothing.

 *       return sql`select * from todos where user_id = ${context.userId}`;
 *     });
 *
 * Signed out with auth on -> throws `UnauthorizedError` (see
 * `verify.server.ts`). With auth disabled (`VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=false`, the
 * shipped default) it resolves the shared dev user — but throws instead when a
 * `DATABASE_URL` is also set, so an app without sign-in must not use this at
 * all. On the auth-on path, use it on every server function that touches
 * per-user data and scope every query by `context.userId`.
